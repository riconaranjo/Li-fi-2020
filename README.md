# Li-fi 2020

This is my capstone project designed to demonstrate the feasibility of using Li-fi Communication for internet access in an indoor environment with multiple concurrent users.

My team is is composed of 4 other members and a supervising professor. My roles in the team are software design, protocol design, and helping with the FPGA subsystems design and implementation.
